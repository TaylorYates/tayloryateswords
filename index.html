        <p class="aboutText">
          I'm a copywriter and journalist who has a seriously wide range of experience, and am, (hopefully?), just the person you're looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          My specialisation area is in music, arts and culture with a talent for interviewing, and have spoken to the likes of Kimbra, London Grammar, Lifehouse, Thelma Plum, Jenny Broke The Window and The Griswolds &ndash; to name few. However, I also have written: for a teen magazine; about what flowers you can use in tea; in the general hard news sector; covered and held an Editorial position in world news and much more. I've also recently branched out into Copywriting for web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also a <a href="tayloryates.github.io/" target="_blank">Front End Web Developer and Web Designer</a> &ndash; and yes, this means I know how to write about these topics as well.

          <p>
            For quite a long time, (I don't remember exactly how long, excuse me!), I was the music columnist at the now defunct Birdee Magazine. As it was a magazine for teenage girls, my language was always fun, cute and empowering &ndash; all while maintaining a solid amount of music cred. It was one of the most viewed and loved parts of the magazine and a lot of the followers still keep in touch with me today.

            Within the first six weeks of commencing my BA in Journalism, I was approached by the Sub-Editor of the Herald Sun and asked if I would be interested in reviewing some Melbourne Comedy Festival shows for them. I was on rotation as an independent writer for the Herald Suns' reviewing of the Melbourne Comedy Festival for a couple of years. The article linked is just one of the many I penned for the publication.
